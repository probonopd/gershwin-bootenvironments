# GNUstep Preference Panes for FreeBSD

This repository contains several GNUstep preference panes designed for FreeBSD systems intended for Gershwin but potentially also useful elsewhere.

## Available Preference Panes

* **Display** - Controls display settings and monitor configuration (using `randr`)
* **Boot Environments** - Manages ZFS boot environments for system snapshots (using FreeBSD ZFS `bectl`)
* **Startup Disk** - Allows users to select which system to boot from (using `efibootmgr`)

See the `README.md` in each respective directory for detailed information.
